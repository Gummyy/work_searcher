The following sections define the domain-specific vocabulary and architecture of the application. Understanding these concepts is essential for working on this codebase.

## What is this repository ?

The software developed in this repository is used to enhance the job offering applications of the user. The user provides a `config.json` file with :
 - a list of resumes he may use to apply, identified by a category
 - a list of cover letters he may use to apply, identified by the same categories as the resumes
 - the job criteria he seeks as an object which translates directly to the API of the website he wishes to browse
 - the [user's profile](#def_user_profile) displaying in great details every skill of the user
 - the [user's preferences](#def_user_profile) explaining in verbose details what exactly the user is looking for

Using these inputs, running the application goes through job offerings matching the criteria on each API and, for each one :
 - ranks how suitable the user is for the position and briefly explains the rank (see [candidate rank](#def_candidate_rank))
 - ranks how suitable the job offering is for the user using the preferences + criteria (see [offering rank](#def_offering_rank))
 - chooses the most relevant resume + cover letter for the offering among the available categories
 - copies the selected resume to a new file named after the job offering `resume_{company}_{position}.pdf`
 - copies the selected cover letter to a new file named after the job offering `letter_{company}_{position}.pdf`
 - modify the last paragraph of the cover letter to reflect the soft skills demanded by the company (teamwork, high quality, communication, ...)

After the offerings are explored, a summary file is generated. This is an Excel were each row represents a job offering and the columns are :
 - [candidate rank](#def_candidate_rank) explanation as a text
 - [candidate rank](#def_candidate_rank) value as an integer between 0 and 100
 - [offering rank](#def_offering_rank) explanation as a text
 - [offering rank](#def_offering_rank) value as an integer between 0 and 100
 - *(Optional)* Google maps itinerary from user's place to the company's adress as a url
 - *(Optional)* Google maps travel time in minutes from user's place to the company's adress as an integer
 - *(Optional)* Yearly gross salary in € (every value in a different metric should be converted) as an integer
 - *(Optional)* Distance between the user's availability date and the offering starting date in days as an integer
 - [final rank](#def_final_rank) value as an integer between 0 and 100
 - [final rank](#def_final_rank) description as a text

## Definitions

The definitions of the concepts and terms used in this repository

### User's profile <a name="def_user_profile"></a>

The user's profile is a textual extended version of its resume.
It contains every feature that may appear on a resume about the user and any usable argument the user could use in a job interview to sum it up, without any restrictions due to space or design. It contains the whole education with as many details as may fit, every self taught skills, some additional descriptions of the universities and courses attended by the user. It contains the description of each job the user has had, in great details, mentioning every tool used, every task started or accomplished.

This document is meant to be as truthfull as possible and detailed enough that only the user could write it.

### User's preferences <a name="def_user_preferences"></a>

The user's preferences are stored in a text file and describe the dream job the user seeks. It may contain various informations such as :
 - the prefered industry
 - size of the company
 - what technology or tools the user prefers
 - how important remote working is
 - how team centric the job should be
 - how important a festive atmosphere at work matters
 - how important managing one's time schedule is
 - hobbies
 - etc

### Candidate rank <a name="def_candidate_rank"></a>

This rank evaluates how likely the user's profile matches the expectations of the recruiter who published the job offering. It is generated by an LLM using the job offering and the [user's profile](#def_user_profile). This value is associated with a short text describing the reasons why the user is or not a good fit.

### Offering rank <a name="def_offering_rank"></a>

This rank evaluates how likely the job offering is to match the preferences of the user. It is generated by an LLM using the job offering and the [user's preferences](#def_user_preferences). This value is associated with a short text describing the reasons why the offering is or not a good fit.

### Final rank <a name="def_final_rank"></a>

This rank aims at quantifying how much the user want to apply to the job offering. It is mathematically computed using the following numeric values in an Excel document (the user may want to modify the coefficients, add additional filters, ...) :
 - [offering rank](#def_offering_rank) : how much the offering suits the [user's preferences](#def_user_preferences)
 - [candidate rank](#def_candidate_rank) : how much the [user's profile](#def_user_profile) matches the offering
 - salary : the more the better, as one would expect
 - daily travel time : computed by the Google maps API ; the smaller the better
 - date availability : the distance in days to the availability date provided in [user's preferences](#def_user_preferences) ; the smaller the absolute value is, the better. The user can eventually use this criteria as a strict filter instead of a preferable value.

## Environment

This repository contains code developed in Python 3.13.7, on a Windows personal computer.
It is executed in the `work_searcher_env` environment whose requirements are accessible in the file `requirements.txt`
The python environment can be activated using these commands in a PowerShell bash :

```shell
cd work_searcher_env/Scripts && .\Activate.ps1
```

The environment variables necessary to connect to the APIs are stored in `.env`.

## Tests

This repository uses pytest as a testing framework.
All the tests are developed in the `./tests/` directory and are named following the syntax `test_$FEATURE.py` (for example `test_linkedin_api.py` or `test_indeed_api.py`)
